1.What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initliaze a repository, .git is created.It is a hidden file because the 
user doesn't actually need to interact with it much.
Initializing a repository lets me to immediately clone the repository to my computer.

2.How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Working directory consists of all the files present in the directory whereas staging area 
consists of those files that are to  be committed and repository contains the files that are \
committed.
Staging area is an intermediate area of keeping the files that we want to commit.
It gives flexibility to change the files that we want to commit before committing.
