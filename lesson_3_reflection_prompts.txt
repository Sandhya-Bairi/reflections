1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I would like to use remote repository for keeping my finished projects as a reference 
  that would be added to my resume.I can access those wherever I am, when my laptop is
  not with me.Also if it is an ongoing project, my teammates can contribute to it. For others,
  they can view the project wihtout any contribution.

2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Pulling changes manually helps in always having the working version of the code,
  if there are some bugs in the code of the remote repository, I would not want that
  wrong code to be in Git. I would prefer keeping the right version of the code rather
  than the wrong one.

3.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

  All three are the ways to add new changes without affecting the existing one.
  Forks are used to import repository from somebody else's github account to mine.
  Clones are used to import a repository from github account to my local computer.
  Branches are used in our local computer Git to have multiple versions of the code 
  with different changes in the same repository. 

  I use fork when I dont have permission to modify someone's file originally.
  I use clone when I want to code on my local computer and check for bugs by compiling
  and executing using various softwares present on my system.
  I use branches when I am in a team project and teammates keep making new changes and commits
  and having immediate access to previous commits.

4.What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  If I have the last known state of the remote stored locally, even when I am not connected
  to internet(github) I can work offline on my local computer and merge the changes if wanted, 
  else need not be merged. 

5.How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

  Without using Git or GitHub, I would use a shared folder in drop box or google docs.
  But then in drop box it may not be easy to work on same part of code at a time by various people.
  Google docs is not actually preferred because changes keep saving automatically and mainly for codes
  we wouldn't be left with a working version due to bugs that cannot be found on google docs.
